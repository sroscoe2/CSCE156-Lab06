-- For each question, write an SQL query to get the specified result. You
-- are highly encouraged to use a GUI SQL tool such as MySQL Workbench and
-- keep track of your queries in an SQL script so that lab instructors can
-- verify your work. If you do, write your queries in the script file
-- provided rather than hand-writing your queries here.

-- 3.1 Executing Queries

-- Simple Queries

-- 5. Write a query that gives just the albumId of the album "Nevermind".


-- Simple Aggregate Queries 
-- ------------------------

-- 6. Write a query to determine how many musicians are in the database.

-- 7. Write a (nested) query to list the oldest album(s) in the database.

-- 8. Write a query to find the total running time (in seconds) of all 
--    tracks on the album *Rain Dogs* by Tom Waits

-- Join Queries 
-- ------------

-- 9. Write a query list all albums in the database along with the album's
--    band, but only include the album title, year and band name.

--     for the band Nirvana.

-- Grouped Join Queries 
-- --------------------

-- 12. Write a query list all bands along with a *count* of how many albums
--     they have in the database (as you saw in the previous query, some should
--     have zero).

-- 13. Write a query that lists all albums in the database along with the
--     number of tracks on them.

-- 14. Write the same query, but limit it to albums which have 12 or more
