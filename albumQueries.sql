# Queries
#
# Name(s): 
#
# 
#
# For each question, write an SQL query to get the specified result. You
# are highly encouraged to use a GUI SQL tool such as MySQL Workbench and
# keep track of your queries in an SQL script so that lab instructors can
# verify your work. If you do, write your queries in the script file
# provided rather than hand-writing your queries here.

# Simple Queries 
# --------------

# 1. List all albums in the database.

# 2. List all albums in the database from newest to oldest.

# 3. List all bands in the database that begin with “The”.

# 4. List all songs in the database in alphabetic order.

# 5. Write a query that gives just the of the album “Nevermind”.


# Simple Aggregate Queries 
# ------------------------

# 6. Write a query to determine how many musicians are in the database.

# 7. Write a (nested) query to list the oldest album(s) in the database.

# 8. Write a query to find the total running time (in seconds) of all 
#    tracks on the album *Rain Dogs* by Tom Waits

# Join Queries 
# ------------

# 9. Write a query list all albums in the database along with the album's
#    band, but only include the album title, year and band name.

# 10. Write a query that lists all albums and all tracks on the albums 
#     for the band Nirvana.

# 11. Write a query that list all bands along with all their albums in 
#     the database *even if they do not have any*.

# Grouped Join Queries 
# --------------------

# 12. Write a query list all bands along with a *count* of how many albums
#     they have in the database (as you saw in the previous query, some should
#     have zero).

# 13. Write a query that lists all albums in the database along with the
      number of tracks on them.

# 14. Write the same query, but limit it to albums which have 12 or more
#     tracks on them.

# 15. Write a query to find all musicians that are not in any bands.

# 16. Write a query to find all musicians that are in more than one band.
